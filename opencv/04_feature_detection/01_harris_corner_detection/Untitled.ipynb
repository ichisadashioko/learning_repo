				"In last chapter, we saw that corners are regions in the image with large variation in intensity in all the directions. One early attempt to find these corners was done by **Chris Harris** and **Mike Stephens** in their paper *A Combined Corner and Edge Detector* in 1988, so now it is called Harris Corner Detector. He took this simple idea to a mathematical form. It basically finds the difference in intensity for a displacement of (u, v) in all directions. This is expressed as below:\n",
				"\n",
				"```\n",
				"E(u, v) = SUM( w(x, y) * [ I(x + u, y + v) - I(x, y)]^2) for all (x, y) in ?\n",
				"```\n",
				"\n",
				"- `I(x + u, y + v)` - shifted intensity"
