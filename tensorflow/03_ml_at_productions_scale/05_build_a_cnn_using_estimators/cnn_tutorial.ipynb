    "## Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the-art model architecture for image classification tasks. CNNs apply a series of filters to the raw pixel data of an image to extract and learn higher-level features, which the model can then use for classification. CNNs contains three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Convolutional layers**, which apply a specified number of convolution filters to the image. For each sub-region, the layer performs a set of mathematical operations to produce a single value in the output feature map. Convolutional layers then typically apply a [ReLu activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) to the output to introduce nonlinearities into the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Pooling layers**, which [downsample the image data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#Pooling_layer) extracted by the convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map in order to decrease processing time. A commonly used pooling algorithm is max pooling, which extracts sub-regions of the feature map (e.g., 2x2-pixel tiles), keeps their maximum value, and discards all other values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Dense (fully connected) layers**, which perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers and downsampled by the pooling layers. In a dense layer, every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Typically, a CNN is composed of a stack of convolutional modules that perform feature extraction. Each module consists of a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer. The last convolutional module is followed by one or more dense layers that perform classification. The final dense layer in a CNN contains a single node for each target class in the model (all the possible classes the model may predict), with a [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) activation function to generate a value between 0-1 for each node (the sum of all these softmax values is equal to 1). We can interpret the softmax values for a given image as relative measurements of how likely it is that the image falls into each target class.\n",
