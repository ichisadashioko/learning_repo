# TensorFlow Guide

- The documents in this unit dive into the details of how TensorFlow works. The units are as follows:

## High Level APIs

- [] [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), TensorFlow's high-level API for building and training deep learning models.
- [] [Eager Execution](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager), an API for writing TensorFlow code imperatively, like you would use NumPy.
- [] [Importing Data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets), easy input pipelines to bring your data into your TensorFlow program.
- [] [Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimators), a high-level API that provides fully-packaged models ready for large-scale training and production.

## Estimators

- [] [Premade Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/premade_estimators), the basics of premade Estimators.
- [] [Checkpoints](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoints), save training progress and resume where you left off.
- [] [Feature Colummns](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns), handle a variety of input data types without changes to the model.
- [] [Datasets for Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets_for_estimators), use [`tf.data`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data) to input data.
- [] [Creating Custom Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/custom_estimators), write your own Estimator.
