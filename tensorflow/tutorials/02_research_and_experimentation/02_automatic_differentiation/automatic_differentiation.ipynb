Tensorflow \"records\" all operations executed inside the context of a `tf.GradientTape` onto a \"tape\". Tensorflow then uses that tape and the gradients associated with each recorded operation to compute the gradients of a \"recorded\" computation using [reverse mode differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation).\n",
