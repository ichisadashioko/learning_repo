    "# [Text generation with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/text/text_generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to generate text using a character-based RNN. We will work with a dataset of Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Given a sequence of characters from this data (\"Shakespear\"), train a model to predict the next character in the sequence (\"e\"). Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.\n",

    "This tutorial includes runnable code implemented using [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/keras) and [eager execution](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/eager).
