The vocabulary (or unique words) in this sentence is (cat, mat, on, sat, the). To represent each word, we will create a zero vector with length equal to the vocabulary, then place a one in the index that corresponds to the word. This approach is shown in the following diagram.\n",

We could then encode the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\" as a dense vector like [5, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2]. This appoach is efficient. Instead of a sparse vector, we now have a dense one (where all elements are full).\n",

				"Word embeddings give us a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding. Importantly, we do not have to specify this encoding by hand. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values (the length of the vector is a parameter you specify). Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are trainable parameters (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer). It is common to see word embeddings that are 8-dimensional (for small datasets), up to 1024-dimensions when working with large datasets. A higher dimentional embedding can capture fine-grained relationships between words, but takes more data to learn.\n",
